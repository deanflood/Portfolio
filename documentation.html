    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Website was developed from scratch, using no template for the bootstrap
            or CSS</li>
        <li>Website is hosted on Github Pages at the URL <a href="http://www.deanflood.ie">www.deanflood.ie</a></li>
		<li>Github Repo for the project is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/deanflood/Portfolio"> my Github </a>
        <li>Bootstrap was used to ensure the website was responsive, and using
            Bootstraps Grid layout, the website looks attractive across
            various screen sizes.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Interactive Elements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To make the website react to users, I used a variety of JQuery
            and CSS elements</li>
        <li>Modals are used to enlarge my user profile image, as well as to
            display a Contact Screen when the user selects the button as
            shown
            </a>
        </li>
        <img src="images/documentation/contactModal.gif" />
        <li>Interactive elements such as the Accordion and navbar were based
            on JQUERY elements found at
            <a href="https://jquery.com/">jquery.com</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://jqueryui.com/accordion/">Jquery Accordion</a> was used
            for displaying experience and results, and <a href="https://jqueryui.com/tabs/">Jquery Tabs</a> were used for the main content on screen.</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp">W3 Slideshow</a> CSS was as a base to display my project work </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dynamic Elements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I introduced two separate  areas where the data is dynamic instead
            of being hardcoded</li>
        <li>This was done using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS</a>, extracting
            the data from JSON Objects and inserting it into the page.</li>
        <li>Both the skill set and result sections are dynamically written
            to the page.</li>
        <li>As these are displayed as tables with more than one colume, my
            logic for the loop had to ensure the data was inserted correctly.</li>

		<li>I achieved  this by using modulus calculation</li>
